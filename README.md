## Classification project from Metis Data Science Bootcamp.

### My current work in progress in human activity recognition from smart home sensor data.

The bulk of this repo is inside the model_building folder, where I connect to a remote 
postgresql server hosted by Gcloud Compute. My best performing ensemble methods didn't make it
 into the repo because of their file size. The flask app is currently not functioning, If
 anybody looking at this has an idea about how to deal with server streaming events inside of
 flask, please reach out to me so I can finish this project! That is, I would like to 
 test out model performance from a simulated live stream of data. 

 Data was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
